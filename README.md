Pakistan Logistics Management Information System (LMIS) is an electronic logistics management system designed, developed and implemented indigenously to infuse efficency in Pakistan public health landscape.  The system is government owned and sustained system, providing updated and reliable supply chain data for vaccines, contraceptives and TB drugs for past more than 8 years. The application has evolved to capture real-time inventory data and product pipeline information to enable it to act as a critical supply management tool; whereby forecasting, quantification, pipeline monitoring and stock management functions are being performed by various government departments based on LMIS data. Over the years the system has started to move in to the centeral stage where multiple vertical stand alone information systems are being interfaced with it to draw consolidated information/analysis across the entire public health supply chain spectrum. 

LMIS was launched in July 2011 through USAID support. However, since then multiple donors e.g. WHO, UNICEF, GAVI, DFID and Gates Foundation have remained involved in LMIS scale-up, capacity building and data use; signifying its larger ownership not only in government but also among donors and UN agencies. 

The system is GS-1 compliant, supports threshold-based triggers/alerts as well as includes all needed supply chain features esp. pipeline and sufficiency of stocks in months of stocks, coverage, slice and dice reports and more. The system offers Zero vendor lock-in (LAMP Stack) with technical capacity available in the open market at a lower cost.  For generating user driven analytics (apart from built in reports) the system makes use of the pivot table and MS-BI 360 (Not included). This is the first step towards decoupling the modules so expect configuration glitches, however later plug and play VMs will follow.

# Contraceptives Logistics Management Information System (CLMIS)
Contraceptive LMIS is formally inaugurated by the then prime minister of Pakistan in 2011. It covers complete supply chain function for health commodities. Currently it is implemented in all district of Pakistan and covers supply chain of all geographical levels. CWH is currently using cLMIS inventory management function (IM), providing real-time, perpetual inventory balances and open fulfillment status. The IM capability is currently being deployed at the district level, and has capability to manage the end-to-end inventory transactions across the supply chain. This allows the IM user to see available balances and all issues/dispatches, including pending actions to be completed. Users are offered other functions, such as warehouse capacity management, views to incoming pipeline supplies and batch management functions. The dashboards provide ample information about Months of Supply, Storage vs Space Occupation Trends, Capacity Occupation of the warehouse, and issue/consumption information. Alerts provided to the IM user include shipment alerts on incoming supplies, and product expiry alerts. 
 All lower levels of the supply chain will use either the data entry function, or integration to other MIS systems, to capture monthly reporting statistics that include opening balance, receipts, adjustments, consumption and ending balance. From this data set, the requisitioning process is used to drive materials based on demand/average usage, to replenish inventories. Capabilities to enforce the use of the requisitioning process have been developed & implemented with various provincial stakeholders. As the Inventory Management module is further deployed, better transaction data will become available for driving a more real-time supply chain planning capability.
